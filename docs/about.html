	</div>

<p>In the last year, i've worked with Bootstrap a lot, implemented it in dozens of website because of it's speed in development. It's a Swiss pocket knife which contains most of the components I use in a day-to-day basis.</p>

<p>When I started to work on a long-term front-end project that prioritized maintainabilty and input of multiple developers, I was eager to use Bootstrap, but evaluating those earlier expierences, it seemed that the code I was writing started to look more and more messy as deadlines approached. So I began my search of improving the use of Bootstrap.</p>

<p>I found SUIT, a framework created by <a href="https://github.com/necolas">Necolas Gallagher</a> which uses a Object Oriented approach to HTML and CSS to keep your code understandable and unclutterd . It has very well documented principles and conventions that fitted my needs the most.</p>

This framework is my current mega-combo of tools containing:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/suitcss/suit">SUIT</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://smacss.com/">SMACCS</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://compass-style.org">Compass</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> and it's plugins</li>
	<li><a href="http://bundler.io/">Bundler</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://editorconfig.org/">Editorconfig</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The Suitstrap documentation is a combination of the documentation of the tools above, to keep it centralized.</p>

<h2>That's a lot!</h2>
<p>Yes, it is a lot. But this framework is made for advanced use. Develop with everything just an uncomment or a command-line away and remove what you don't need in your production-code. Add your own custom code without being incomprehensible to your collegues. It's a website / -application specific factory which rolls out an amazing product at the end of it's assembly line.</p>
