// Heads up! v3 launched with with only `.HideText()`, but per our pattern for
// mixins being reused as classes with the same name, this doesn't hold up. As
// of v3.0.1 we have added `.TextHide()` and deprecated `.HideText()`. Note
// that we cannot chain the mixins together in Less, so they are repeated.

// New mixin to use as of Bootstrap v3.0.1
@mixin TextHide() {
	font: 0/0;
	color: transparent;
	text-shadow: none;
	background-color: transparent;
	border: 0;
}

// Deprecated as of v3.0.1 (will be removed in Bootstrap v4)
@mixin HideText() {
	@include TextHide;
}
