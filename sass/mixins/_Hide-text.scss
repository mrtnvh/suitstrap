/**
 * CSS image replacement
 *
 * Heads up! v3 launched with with only `.HideText()`, but per our pattern for
 * mixins being reused as classes with the same name, this doesn't hold up. As
 * of v3.0.1 we have added `.TextHide()` and deprecated `.HideText()`. Note
 * that we cannot chain the mixins together in Less, so they are repeated.
